if there are at least two players, a game exists. And there are two kinds of
games: finite games and infinite games.

##### finite games
Finite games are played by known players. They have fixed rules. And
there is an agreed-upon objective that, when reached, ends the game.

example: Football, for example, is a finite game. The players all wear uniforms and
are easily identifiable. There is a set of rules, and referees are there to
enforce those rules. All the players have agreed to play by those rules and
they accept penalties when they break the rules. Everyone agrees that
whichever team has scored more points by the end of the set time period
will be declared the winner, the game will end and everyone will go home.
In finite games, there is always a beginning, a middle and an end.

##### infinite games
Infinite games, in contrast, are played by known and unknown players.
There are no exact or agreed-upon rules. Though there may be conventions
or laws that govern how the players conduct themselves, within those broad
boundaries, the players can operate however they want. And if they choose
to break with convention, they can. The manner in which each player
chooses to play is entirely up to them. And they can change how they play
the game at any time, for any reason.
Infinite games have infinite time horizons. And because there is no
finish line, no practical end to the game, there is no such thing as “winning”
an infinite game. In an infinite game, the primary objective is to keep
playing, to perpetuate the game.

##### The Infinite Game of Business
business is an infinite game

Which means, to succeed in the Infinite
Game of business, we have to stop thinking about who wins or who’s the
best and start thinking about how to build organizations that are strong
enough and healthy enough to stay in the game for many generations to
come. The benefits of which, ironically, often make companies stronger in
the near term also.

##### A Tale of Two Players
so the author went to two different events, microsoft event and apple one, about teaching students and stuff. At the microsoft event, a good portion of folks talked about how they're going to beat apple and stuff. While, at the apple event folks just talked about how apple was trying to help teachers teach and help students learn. One group seemed obsessed with beating their competition. The other
group seemed obsessed with advancing a cause.

The author recieved a zune (ipod clone) as a gift and thought it was good and all then showed it to an Apple Executive and told him that his zune was better than the ipod. The apple guy smiled and said "and I have no doubt sir". Apparently, he had something else at play but his reponse was consistent with that of a leader with an infinite mindset. (spoiler art: the apple exec knew the fucking iphone woudl drop really soon lmao L)

##### The Benefits of an Infinite Mindset
In the Infinite Game, the true value of an organization cannot be measured
by the success it has achieved based on a set of arbitrary metrics over
arbitrary time frames. The true value of an organization is measured by the
desire others have to contribute to that organization’s ability to keep
succeeding, not just during the time they are there, but well beyond their
own tenure. While a finite-minded leader works to get something from their
employees, customers and shareholders in order to meet arbitrary metrics,
the infinite-minded leader works to ensure that their employees, customers
and shareholders remain inspired to continue contributing with their effort,
their wallets and their investments. Players with an infinite mindset want to
leave their organizations in better shape than they found them. Lego
invented a toy that has stood the test of time not because it was lucky, but
because nearly everyone who works there wants to do things to ensure that
the company will survive them. Their drive is not to beat the quarter, their
drive is to “continue to create innovative play experiences and reach more
children every year.”
